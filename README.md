# Reusable CAPTCHA security engine Project using Java
Generate captcha is very simple, it basically validates two values one which we kept in session when we are rendering the captcha and one which user enters, so before going further after login we validate captcha values like session captcha value and user entered value so if both are equals then we are allowing user to go further, and if does not match then return back with proper message like captcha is invalid please try again.t
